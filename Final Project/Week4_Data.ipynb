    "<h3>I. Data Requirements</h3>\n",
    "<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Data is the main source for starting and completing a recommender model that will answer questions and provide solutions with a mathematical approach in programming and knowledge domain intuition. Data can answer question which are unimaginable and non-answerable by humans because humans do not have the tendency to analyze such large dataset and produce analytics to find a solutions. To solve the problem, we will need the following data:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) every district in Jakarta area to populate all food & beverage services based on their category and find out what kind of category is the most frequent occurrence.</li>\n",
    "<li>Population of each district.</li>\n",
    "<li>The list of all food & beverage services in every district using Foursquare API that will be used to perform clustering on the districts.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this final project, each of the data needed in the previous chapter can be found from 4 different sources:\n",

    "<li>This page contains list of neigbourhoods (districts) from each borough in Jakarta, with total of 42 neigbourhoods from 5 boroughs.</li>\n",

    "<li>All data are provided in 3 datatype formats (.csv, .json, and .sql) but we will only use csv and json data formats.</li>\n",
    "<li>We will  find all the borough's code from json file based on the data that we gather from point 1, after that we use those codes to find all neighbourhoods in csv file including latitude & longitude informations from each neighbourhood.</li>\n",

    "<li>This site is one of the official websites of the Indonesian government specifically in the Jakarta area which provides population data for each district in the form of CSV files but the latest data is provided only in 2014 while this project begins in 2020 so that there should be many changes, especially in the size of the number residents of each district within a period of 6 years.</li>\n",
    "<li>With this data, we will gather all population of each district and join it with the table from point 2.</li>\n",

    "<li>Foursquare API will provide many categories of the food & beverage service data, use of Foursquare is focused to fetch nearest venue locations so that we can use them to form a cluster in order to help us to solve the business problem put forward.</li>\n",
